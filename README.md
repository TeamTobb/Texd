# Texd
###### Texd is a collaborative writing tool with support for extensions. The system can be run as a local server, and uses the strengths found in the MEAN-stack.

## About
The project was initially a bachelor assignment given at NTNU.
The project is based on ideas from document preparation systems such as latex and collaborative writing tools such as Google Docs. The project is trying take ideas from these systems and create a new way to think about documents. It is based on modern technology to see how that affects the development of such a system.
The foundation of the application is based on [MEAN Typescript Angular2 Skeleton](https://github.com/TeamTobb/MEAN-Typescript-Angular2-Skeleton).
